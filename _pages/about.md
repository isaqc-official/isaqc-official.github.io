  Quantum computing and quantum information technology are expected to provide a distinctive edge in computing power which far outclasses any technology of our time with its potential applications ranging from cryptography and security to drug design and generative chemistry.

 We are a research club with a focus on systematically building a solid foundation for all members of ISAQC through lectures, seminars and quantum programming workshops along with giving you a working knowledge of quantum algorithms and their applications with the hope that you might be able to design an algorithm of your own someday!
