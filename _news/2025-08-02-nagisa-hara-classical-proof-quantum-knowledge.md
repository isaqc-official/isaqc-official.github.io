In a proof of knowledge (PoK), a verifier becomes convinced that a prover possesses privileged information. In combination with zero-knowledge proof systems, PoKs are an important part of secure protocols such as digital signature schemes and authentication schemes as they enable a prover to demonstrate possession of a certain piece of information (such as a private key or a credential), without revealing it. Formally, A PoK is defined via the existence of an extractor, which is capable of reconstructing the key information that makes a verifier accept, given oracle access to the prover. We extend the concept of a PoK in the setting of a single classical verifier and two quantum provers, and exhibit the PoK property for a non-local game for the local Hamiltonian problem. More specifically, we construct an extractor which, given oracle access to a provers' strategy that leads to high acceptance probability, is able to reconstruct the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Our result can be seen as a new form of self-testing, where, in addition to certifying a pre-shared entangled state and the prover's strategy, the verifier also certifies a local quantum state. This technique thus provides a method to ascertain that a prover has access to a quantum system, in particular, a ground state, thus indicating a new level of verification for a proof of quantumness.
