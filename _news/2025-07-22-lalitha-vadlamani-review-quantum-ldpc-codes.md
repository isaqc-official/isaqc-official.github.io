CSS codes are a class of quantum codes which are constructed based on pairs of dual-containing classical codes. In this talk, we will review CSS codes briefly. Then, we will discuss hypergraph product codes whose rate grows linearly and distance grows as square root of the block length. We will move on to a construction of QLDPC codes known as lifted product codes, whose rate grows as log(N) and distance grows as N/log(N). Finally, we will cover some details about quantum Tanner codes which are extensions of lifted product codes. Quantum Tanner codes themselves have linear rate and distance.
