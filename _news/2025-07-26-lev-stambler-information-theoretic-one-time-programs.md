We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to non-adaptive, constant depth, and D-dimensional geometrically-local quantum circuit for some constant D. We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits. Notably though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order 2) along with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific 2↦1 QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest as well.
