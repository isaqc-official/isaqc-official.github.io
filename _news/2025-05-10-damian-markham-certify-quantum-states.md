Quantum states act as resources in many quantum information tasks, in particular entangled states for quantum networks allow for security, communication complexity and distributed sensing not possible classically.In order to exploit this advantage, it is important to be sure the state that is the one that is expected - this is the problem of certification. We present some general techniques for verification and certification of quantum states for networks and their applications.
